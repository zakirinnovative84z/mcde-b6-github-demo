--Section 3 — JOINs

--Task 12:  List every product along with its brand name and category name.
--Hint: JOIN production.products with production.brands and production.categories.
SELECT p.product_name,
b.brand_name,
c.category_name
FROM production.products AS p
JOIN production.brands AS b
ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id
JOIN production.categories AS c
ON p.category_id = c.category_id;

--Task 13:  List all orders with the customer's full name (first_name + last_name), order date, and order status.
SELECT c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name AS full_name,
o.order_date,
o.order_status
FROM sales.customers AS c
JOIN sales.orders AS o
ON c.customer_id= o.customer_id;

--Task 14:  Show every order item with the product name, quantity, list price, and discount.
SELECT 
p.product_name,
oi.quantity,
oi.list_price,
oi.discount
FROM sales.order_items AS oi
JOIN production.products AS p
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

--Task 15:  List each staff member's full name alongside their store name.
SELECT s.first_name+' '+s.last_name AS Full_name,
ss.store_name 
FROM sales.staffs AS s
JOIN sales.stores AS ss
ON s.store_id = ss.store_id;

--Task 16:  List staff members along with their manager's full name.
--Hint: Use a self-join on the sales.staffs table using manager_id.
SELECT
s.staff_id,
s.first_name+ ' '+ s.last_name AS staff_name,
m.first_name+ ' '+ m.last_name AS manager_name
FROM sales.staffs AS s
LEFT JOIN sales.staffs AS m
ON s.manager_id = m.staff_id;

--Task 17:  Show all stores and the products they have in stock, including the product name and quantity. Only show items where quantity > 0.
SELECT s.store_name,p.product_name,ps.quantity
FROM sales.stores AS s
JOIN production.stocks AS ps
ON s.store_id = ps.store_id
JOIN production.products AS p
ON p.product_id = ps.product_id
WHERE ps.quantity > 0;

--Task 18:  List all customers who placed at least one order. Show customer name and order date.
--Hint: An INNER JOIN naturally eliminates non-ordering customers.
SELECT c.customer_id,
c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name AS full_name,
o.order_date
FROM sales.customers AS c
INNER JOIN sales.orders AS o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

--Task 19:  List ALL customers and their orders (if any). Customers who never ordered should still appear with NULL order data.
--Hint: Use a LEFT JOIN.
SELECT c.first_name,o.order_id,o.order_date
FROM sales.customers AS c
LEFT JOIN sales.orders AS o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
